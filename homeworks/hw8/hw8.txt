CS 161 - Homework 8

1. see test.net file

To make Pr(D|T) >= 0.3 use the following constraints:
    - disease >= 0.8942%
    - false positive <= 0.2219%
    - there exists no constraint for false negative that can make
    Pr(D|T) >= 0.3

2. a. Most likely instantiation given light sensor and not sound sensor:
    - SoundSensorHealth => OK
    - DogBarking => No
    - HearableBarking => No
    - Battery => OK
    - DogOutside => Yes
    - OutdoorLight => On
    - LightSensorHealth => OK
    - DogBowelTrouble => Yes
    - FamilyHome => No
    - ExpectingGuests => No

    Obtained the answer by setting up the causal structure and loading
    in the sambot.dat file. Locked in the given values and viewed the 
    monitors of the other nodes after the givens were factored in.

b. Most likely instantiation of sensors given that family is home and
no guests are expected
    - LightSensor => Off
    - SoundSensor => Off
 
    Obtained the answer by setting up the causal structure and loading
    in the sambot.dat file. Locked in the given values and viewed the 
    monitors of the other nodes after the givens were factored in.

c. Smallest set of variables Z in the network that make the two sensors
independent.
    Z = {Battery, FamilyHome}

    Both Battery and FamilyHome are divergent nodes that cover all paths
    from SoundSensor to LightSensor in the Bayesian network. If these
    two values are known then LightSensor and SoundSensor will be d_separated

d. Type of network constructed = multiply-connected network
    (There are cycles in the causal structure)
