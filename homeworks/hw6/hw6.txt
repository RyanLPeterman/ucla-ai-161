CS 161 - Homework 6

1. For each pair of atomic sentences, give the most general unifier if it exists:
    a) P(A, B, B), P(x, y, z).
        - no unifier exists since y and z cannot both be bound to B
    b) Q(y, G(A, B)), Q(G(X, x), y).
        - 
    c) R(x, A, z), R(B, y, z)
        - B = x, A = y
    d) Older(Father(y), y), Older(Father(x), John).
        - John = x
    e) Knows(Father(y), y), Knows(x, x).
        - no unifier exists

2. Consider the following:
    - John likes all kinds of food
    - Apples are food
    - Chicken is food
    - Anything anyone eats and isn't killed by is food
    - If you are killed by something, you are not alive
    - Bill eats peanuts and is still alive
    - Sue eats everything Bill eats
∃

    a) 
    - ∀ x, ∃ j : food(x) => likes(j, x) - for all x s.t. x is food, j likes x
    - food(apple)
    - food(chicken)
    - ∀ x, y : eats(x, y) and not kills(x, y) => food(y)
    - ∀ x, ∃ y : kills(x, y) => not alive(x)
    - ∃ b, p : eats(b, p) and alive(b)
    - ∃ s, b ∀ x : eats(b, x) => eats(s, x)
    b)
